    "experiment_description": "Monkeys were trained to perform an instructed-delay reaching task in order to drive task-related neural activity in primary motor and dorsal premotorcortex where our electrodes were located. We trained the monkey to use his right hand to grasp and translate a custom 3D printed handle (Shapeways, Inc.) attached to a haptic feedback device (Delta.3, Force Dimension, Inc.). The monkey was trained to perform a delayed reaching task by moving the haptic device cursor towards green rectangular targets displayed on the screen. Successful completion of each movement triggered a juice reward."

This last step was important for achieving consistent, stable sorts with KiloSort 2.0 "
